# cuttlefish

**cuttlefish** has morphed from my original intention of a host-distributed webapp enumeration tool, into an automated scanning tool for single-host penetration testing. I am going to enroll in OSCP's PWK soon, and want to have a tool that will help me perform automated host enumeration. Additionally, I wanted to learn `go`.
