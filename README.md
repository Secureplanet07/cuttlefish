# cuttlefish

**cuttlefish** is an outgrowth of my frustration with enumerating hosts with hard to find files/directories in CTF-style offensive security practice. Sometimes, enumerations that yielded success could reach timelines of up to 6.5+ hours with over 200,000 unique combinations of words to test. This becomes unfeasible or practically inefficient fairly rapidly, especially if using wordlists with permutations on common file names. This project aims to ease the pain of large-scale enumeration by using concurrent, distributed, enumeration through an automated, dynamic, network of AWS-hosted ec2 instance "tentacles".

I thought about docker, but the overhead for spinning up a new container seems to be more bloated than expected. Additionally, these runs are generally fairly resource intensive, and to really distribute the load here, I'm thinking about running 10-12 concurrent instances of micro-tier instances. This gets resource-impractical with docker fairly quickly, as thread exhaustion is probably the limiting resource when running these requests. So spinning up 10-12 instances of 50 "thread" applications on 10-12 different instances means that the thread/CPU load remains constant, while with docker containers, the thread/CPU load increases dramatically with each added container.
